# No Mans Blocks Master Server

This project is a account server for my game No Mans Blocks. It uses the following dependencies:  

* Express
* TypeORM
* Sqlite
* Typescript
* Body-parser
* Gulp
        
        
Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Setup database settings inside `ormconfig.json` file
3. Run `npm start` command

Visual Studio Code support has been added. After opening the root folder
in VS code you will be able to build the typescript code using ctrl-shift-b,
and run the server via the 'Start Server' task.
